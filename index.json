[{"content":"The Origins of Information Theory A particular quantity called entropy is used in thermodynamics and in statistical mechanics. A quantity called entropy is used in communication theory. After all thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are older than communication theory. From these facts we might conclude that communication theory somehow grew out of statistical mechanics.\nThis easy but misleading idea has caused a great deal of confusion even among technical men. Actually, communication theory evolved from an effort to solve certain problems in the field of electrical communication. Its entropy was called by mathematical analogy with the entropy of statistical mechanics.\nWhile thermodynamics gave us the concept of entropy, it does not give a detailed picture of entropy, in terms of positions and velocities of molecules, for instance. Statistical mechanics does give a detailed mechanical meaning to entropy in particular cases. In general, the meaning is that an increase in entropy means a decrease in order. Order in the sense in which it is used in statistical mechanics involves unpredictability based on a lack of knowledge of the positions and velocities of molecules.\nIn communication theory we consider a message source, such as a writer or a speaker, which may produce on a given occasion any one of many possible messages. The amount of information conveyed by the message increases as the amount of uncertainty as to what message actually will be produced becomes greater. A message which is one out of ten messages conveys a smaller amount of information than a message which is one out of a million possible messages. The entropy of communication theory is a measure of this uncertainty and the uncertainty, or entropy is taken as the measure of the amount of information conveyed by a message source.\nIn single-current telegraphy we have two elements out of which to construct our code: current and no current, which we might call 1 and 0. In double-current telegraphy we really have three elements, which we might characterize as forward current; no current; backward current; or as +1,0,-1. In 1874 Thomas Edison went further; in his quadruplex telegraph system he used two intensities of current as well as two directions of current. How much information it is possible to send over a circuit depends not only on how fast one can send successive symbols over the circuit but also on how many different symbols one has avaible to choose among.\nThen use of multiplicity of symbols can lead to difficulties. Dots and dashes sent over a long cable tend to spread out and overlap. Thus, when we look for one symbol at the far end we see a little of several others.\nExtraneous currents, which we call noise are always present to interfere with signals sent. Thus, even if we avoid the overlapping of dots and spaces which is called symbol interference, noise tends to distort received signal.\nReferences [1] Pierce, J. R. (2012).
